# 🧠 GPT-2 Text Generation
This project demonstrates how to generate coherent paragraphs based on user prompts using **GPT-2**, a pre-trained language model from Hugging Face.
## ✅ Deliverable
> A Python script (`generate_text_gpt2.py`) that takes a user prompt as input and returns generated text using the GPT-2 model.
## ⚙️ Requirements
Install required Python packages using pip:
```bash
pip install transformers torch
## ▶️ How to Run
### 📌 In Python IDLE or Terminal:
```bash
python generate_text_gpt2.py
You’ll be prompted to enter a sentence. For example:
Enter your prompt: The future of technology is
📝 Generated Text:
The future of technology is full of potential and innovation. Experts believe that artificial intelligence and quantum computing will lead to...

## 💡 How It Works

- Loads the `gpt2` model and tokenizer from Hugging Face
- Encodes the user prompt and generates continuation text
- Applies `top-k`, `top-p`, and `temperature` sampling to enhance diversity

## 🔁 Example Prompts

- "Once upon a time"
- "Climate change is affecting"
- "Machine learning in healthcare will"

## 🙋 Support

If you encounter model loading issues, ensure:
- You have a working internet connection the first time
- Enough disk space (~500MB for gpt2)
